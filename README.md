THEN they will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history</li>
<li>WHEN user will view current weather conditions for that city.
THEN user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.</li>
